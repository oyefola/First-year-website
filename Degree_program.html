              This module introduces the fundamental Software Engineering
              concepts needed to develop software systems that can meet basic
              functional requirements within a given problem domain,the
              programming language used for this purpose is ruby. The module
              covers the major stages of system development, from requirements
              analysis to implementation and testing. The module also covers the
              basics of project management, including the use of tools and
              techniques for planning, scheduling, monitoring, and controlling
              software projects.

              This module focuses on the development of mathematical concepts
              and techniques that are fundamental to computing. It lays the
              groundwork for future computing modules by teaching students how
              to apply various mathematical concepts and techniques in analysing
              and understanding important areas of computing. Mathematical
              techniques learned in this module contribute to the study of
              computing by helping students develop logical arguments,
              understand the relevance of computing contexts, and construct
              appropriate models of computing systems and structures.

              The Java programming language is used to introduce computer
              programming in this module. At the start of the course, no prior
              knowledge of Java or computer programming is required; however, by
              the end of the course, the entire class should be able to write
              clear, readable, maintainable, and testable Java programmes. The
              course will cover the basic syntax of the Java language, as well
              as more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming,
              recursion, and data structures. Ultimately, the goal is for
              students to be able to use Java to solve real-world problems.

              This module introduces Artificial Intelligence and key concepts
              and problems in the field, such as whether a computer can
              understand and whether humans should be considered machines. It
              also provides a brief historical overview of the subject as well
              as a review of the state-of-the-art and open questions in some of
              the major sub-areas of AI, highlighting connections to
              Departmental research. In addition, this module will explore the
              ethical implications of AI, and future directions for the field.
              By the end of this module, students will have a good understanding
              of the basic concepts and issues in AI, as well as how AI is being
              used in research today.

              The module begins with an overview of computer architecture,
              discussing digital logic, computer arithmetic, and instruction set
              architecture. It then delves into how the basic elements of a
              computer are combined to create more sophisticated architectures,
              including cache memory and pipelining. The second half of the
              module looks at how computing devices can be networked together,
              covering topics such as layered protocols, error
              detection/correction, and reliable network transmission.

              This module will give students a comprehensive introduction to
              front-end web development, teaching them how to build interactive
              and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In
              addition, the module will cover important topics such as
              accessibility, legal issues, and information security. By the end
              of the module, students will have a strong understanding of how to
              develop websites from start to finish, giving them the skills they
              need to start their careers in web development.
