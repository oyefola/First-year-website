            This website is designed to be accessible to as many people as
            possible. The content is zoomable, so you can enlarge it if you need
            to. It's also compatible with screen readers, so people who are
            blind or have low vision can access the information. The two main
            colours used on the website are easy to distinguish, so people with
            visual impairments can easily see the information.

          <p class="content">
            I used the rem measurement unit, in case a user wants to zoom into
            the page to see the content better. According to
            <a
              href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-rem-in-css/#:~:text=Using%20REM%20(or%20another%20relative,due%20to%20a%20visual%20impairment."
              >freeCodeCamp</a
            >
            , REM is a good value to use for font-size because it is relative to
            the default font-size set by the user, meaning that it will resize
            accordingly if the user needs to zoom in. This is important for
            accessibility, as some users may need to zoom in up to 400% in order
            to read the text.

            <br />
            <br />
            I made sure that all my images have descriptive alt captions to aid
            smooth running of a screen reader for users with visual impairments.
            The alt text is an important part of accessible web design. Its
            original purpose is to describe images to visitors who are unable to
            see them. This includes screen readers and browsers that block
            images, but it also includes users who are sight-impaired or
            otherwise unable to visually identify an image. Including alt text
            with your images ensures that all users, regardless of visual
            ability, can appreciate the content on your site.(<a

            <br />
            <br />
            I mades sure that my color scheme was simple and there was a high
            contrast between them.I also ensured that no information was
            dependent on color to be conveyed.
            <br />
            <br />
            I used role="img" for the svg images so screen readers recognise
            them as images.
