        <p id="sga-body">
        The Sheffield Graduate Attributes framework is a presentation of attributes that are beneficial to the student's academic success,
         personal development and employability. These attributes and skills are developed through academic programmes, extra-curricular activities, 
         learning experiences and work experiences. The mySkills portfolio is a tool that encourages students to reflect on their strengths and set
         personal development goals.Read more about them <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/skills/sga">here.</a>

          The mySkills platform has been instrumental in tracking my progress as I develop various skills. For example, I have developed skills in:

                <h2>Research and critical thinking: </h2>
                <p>
                  Before I resumed my studies at the university, I was already relatively proficient in research
                  and critical thinking skills. However, I feel like I have further developed these skills now, as assignments and class exercises are easier
                  for me to complete. This is especially true for those tasks which require me to use my programming language knowledge from earlier classes to 
                  solve problems. The mySkills portfolio has helped me document this progress.

                <h2>Digital capabilty: </h2>
                <p>
                  Since joining the computer science program at my university, I have seen a marked improvement in my digital skills.
                  I am now able to do things with the internet and my personal computer that I could not do before, or was even aware of.
                This has been a valuable asset in my development as a computer science student.

              <h2>Positive Well-being: </h2>
              <p>
                  I feel that my sense of positive wellbeing has increased since starting University. 
                  I think this is because University can be a very fast-paced and stressful environment, so it is important to have a good sense of 
                  wellbeing to help cope with the pressure.
