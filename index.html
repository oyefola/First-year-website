                Hi there!<br />
                My name is Folademilade, and I'm from Lagos, Nigeria. I'm
                currently in my first year of studying computer science at the
                University of Sheffield. I'm passionate about using technology
                to solve problems and make people's lives easier. In my spare
                time, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and spending time
                with my friends and family. I'm excited to see what the future
                holds for me and my career in computer science!

          <p id="educational-background-content">
            I attended Aunty Ayo International School for my primary and
            secondary education, located in Lagos, Nigeria. After that, I began
            a foundation degree for medicine at the University of Lagos but
            eventually found that my real passion was in computer science. So, I
            completed a foundation year for computer science at Oxbridge
            Tutorial college in Lagos, Nigeria and I am currently enrolled at
            the University of Sheffield for my degree in computer science. If
            you want to know more about the modules I am taking, please select
            the "Degree programme" option from the main menu.
